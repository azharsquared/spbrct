**Test-driven development (TDD)** is a practice in software development where you write tests
before writing the actual code. The idea is to ensure that your code meets the criteria or requirements that are set


1. Write a test
2. Write the code to make the test pass
3. Refactor the code
4. Repeat
5. Done


TDD is an iterative process that helps to ensure that your code works and that new features donâ€™t
break other parts of the software. This is also called regression testing.
