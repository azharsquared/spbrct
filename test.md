  - For mocking objects in unit tests
- [AssertJ](https://assertj.github.io/doc/)

test types 
- Unit tests (Junit)
  - Unit tests focus on the smallest component of software. 
  - will ensure that it works correctly in isolation. 
  - Mocking is often used in unit testing to replace the dependencies of the unit that is being tested
- Integration tests (Junit)
  - focus on the interaction between individual components.
  - ensuring that individual components work together as expected.
- Functional tests
  - Functional testing focuses on business scenarios that are defined in functional specifications.
  - Test cases are designed to verify that software meets the specified requirements.
- Regression tests
  - designed to verify that new code or code updates do not break existing functionality
- Usability tests
  - Usability tests verify that software is user-friendly, intuitive, and easy to
    use from an end-user perspective. Usability tests focus more on the frontend and user
    experience
