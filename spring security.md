By default, Spring Security enables the following features:
- An **AuthenticationManager** bean with an in-memory single user. The username is user
and the password is printed to the console output.
- Ignored paths for common static resource locations, such as /css and /images. HTTP
basic authentication for all other endpoints.
- Security events published to Springâ€™s ApplicationEventPublisher interface.
- Common low-level features turned on by default, including HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
- A default autogenerated login page
